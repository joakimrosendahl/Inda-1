Testing the first lab the course 1337 at KTH. My objective is to increas my familiarity with several different programing languages in a relatively easy way.

Down here is the lab description

Exercise 1.2 -- Arithmetic.java
Create another file in src called Arithmetic.java. Your next tasks will be to create some methods in this Java class for performing basic arithmetic operations.

Exericse 1.3 -- Sum
Create a method called sum that takes two arguments of type int and returns their sum as an int. The method header should be:

public int sum(int a, int b)

Exercise 1.4 -- Difference
Create a method called difference that returns the difference between two integers, that is, difference(2, 5) should return -3 (2 - 5). The method header should be:

public int difference(int a, int b)
Exercise 1.5 -- Average
Create a method called average that takes two doubles as arguments and returns their arithmetic average. For example, if you call average(3.0, 4.0), you should get the result 3.5. The method header should be:

public double average(double a, double b)
Assistant's note: Note that the header of average differs from the two previous methods - its parameters are doubles, not ints, and its return type should be a double.

Exercise 1.6 -- don't forget to git!
When you are done with your assignment, you must push it to your repository on Github. If you don't do this, any changes you have made will only be present on your local machine and your TA will not be able to grade your assignment. If you are uncertain how to push your files, we have provided you with a brief walktrough.
